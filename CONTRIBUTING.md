### **General house keeping**

PetaPoco has coding standards and guidelines. 
- We use the [Framework Design Guidelines] and all code should try and follow these guidelines. 
- All public APIs should include XML doc comments. See [XML Documentation Comments (C# Programming Guide)]
- All bug fixes should include a unit test(s). 
- All features **must** include a unit test(s) and an integration test(s).

Contributing to PetaPoco
=========================

There are a number of ways you can contribute to the PetaPoco project:

* Identifying issues - report them.
* Identifying defects - Report as an issue, then PR (to development) a failing unit test(s).
* Fixing defects - Report as an issue, then PR (to development) a fix and supporting unit test(s).
* Implementing features - Report as an issue, wait for the community to agree, then PR (to development) the feature and supporting unit test(s) and integration test(s). If you don't get the go-ahead for a feature, please don't be offended if your PR is not pulled.
