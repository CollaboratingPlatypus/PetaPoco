# Welcome to the official PetaPoco repository

Originally the brainchild of [Brad Robinson],

## PetaPoco is a tiny, fast, single-file micro-ORM for .NET and Mono

* Like [Dapper], it's fast because it uses dynamic method generation (MSIL) to assign column values to properties
* Like [Massive] it's available as single file that you easily add to any project or complied.
* Like [Massive], it now also supports dynamic Expandos too - [read more](http://www.toptensoftware.com/blog/posts/104-PetaPoco-Not-So-Poco-or-adding-support-for-dynamic)
* Unlike [Massive] it works with strongly typed [POCO]'s
* Like [ActiveRecord], it supports a close relationship between object and database table
* Like [SubSonic], it supports generation of poco classes with T4 templates

## Features at a Glance

* Tiny, and absolutely no dependencies!
* Works with strictly undecorated POCOs, or attributed almost-POCOs.
* Easy to configure and includes [fluent configuration] out of the box.
* Helper methods for Insert/Delete/Update/Save and IsNew
* Paged requests automatically work out total record count and fetch a specific page.
* Easy transaction support.
* Better parameter replacement support, including grabbing named parameters from object properties.
* Great performance by eliminating Linq and fast property assignment with DynamicMethod generation.
* The query language is good ole SQL.
* Includes a low friction SQL builder class that makes writing inline SQL *much* easier.
* Includes T4 templates to automatically generate POCO classes for you.
* Hooks for logging exceptions, installing value converters and mapping columns to properties without attributes.
* Works with SQL Server, SQL Server CE, MS Access, SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, Firebird, and PostgreSQL. (Oracle supported but does not have integration tests).
* Works under .NET 4.0/4.5/4.6 or Mono 2.8 and later.
* Has [Xunit] unit tests.
* Has supported DBs integration tests.
* OpenSource (Apache License)
* All of this in about 1,500 lines of code

## Super easy use and configuration

Save an entity
```c#
    db.Save(article);
    db.Save(new Article { Title = "Super easy to use PetaPoco" });
    db.Save("Articles", "Id", { Title = "Super easy to use PetaPoco", Id = Guid.New() });
```

Get an entity
```c#
    var article = db.Single<Article>(123);
    var article = db.Single<Article>("WHERE ArticleKey = @0", "ART-123");
```

Delete an entity
```c#
    db.Delete(article);
    db.Delete<Article>(123);
    db.Delete("Articles", "Id", 123);
    db.Delete("Articles", "ArticleKey", "ART-123");
```
